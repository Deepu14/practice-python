"""This exercise is Part 1 of 4 of the Tic Tac Toe exercise series. 
The other exercises are: Part 2, Part 3, and Part 4.
Time for some fake graphics! Letâ€™s say we want to draw game boards that look like this:

 --- --- --- 
|   |   |   | 
 --- --- ---  
|   |   |   | 
 --- --- ---  
|   |   |   | 
 --- --- --- 
This one is 3x3 (like in tic tac toe). Obviously, they come in many other sizes 
(8x8 for chess, 19x19 for Go, and many more)."""
